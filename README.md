Project Definition

To play or listen to digital audio files, we require an application. The tool used to play MP3s and other digital audio files is the MP3 player. The MP3 GUI software program makes an effort to simulate the real MP3 Player. You can use your desktop or laptop to play songs, music, and all MP3 files thanks to this program. 
 
The ability for users to play MP3 and digital audio files is the major goal of this project. The application needs a straightforward but attractive user interface to keep people interested. 
 
Python is the programming language used to create this GUI project. The Python Tkinter library is used to create the application's graphical user interface (GUI). The Pygame and Mutagen libraries are used by the interactive portion of the program that works with MP3 files. 
 
An interface for listing the available MP3 files is possible. The option to list other digital audio files that aren't MP3 can also be provided to consumers. Additionally, customers will look for an interface on the MP3 player that provides details about the file being played. The name of the file, its size, the number of plays and skips, expressed in minutes and seconds, are just a few of the details you might include. 
You can interact with multimedia files in only a few lines of code thanks to Python's libraries that can play audio files, such Pygame. Pymedia and Simpleaudio are similar libraries. Numerous digital audio files can be handled by these libraries. They are not only capable of handling MP3 files. You may also add a function that lets users make playlists. You will want a database to hold the data on the created playlists in order to accomplish this. You can utilize the SQLite database thanks to the sqlite3 package for Python.
Because it is file-based and simpler to set up than other SQL databases, the SQLite database is a preferable choice in this scenario. Despite being a file-based system, SQLite saves data more effectively than a regular file. 

Project Formulation

During app development, there might be some issues with the responsiveness of the UI in some devices with small screen sizes. 
>> The developers will code and test the app frequently to avoid compatibility issues with older Windows versions with various screen sizes. 
>> The team members would not limit themselves in terms of creativity. However, keeping in mind the limited amount of time available for completion, the app won’t be having additional features other than the ones specified above. 
>> The overall app structure will be made robust and bug-free over the period of development. 
>> After the release of the final build, the app will be tested on different Windows devices in order to ensure the best experience regardless of the PC being used. 
>> Testing and final checks will be done before submission of the project. 
>> To build associate degree MP3 player victimisation Python artificial language to be able to play and hear songs, MP3 files and alternative digital audio files.
>> Determine the functionalities of the MP3 player.
>> The player ought to be have a straightforward and simple to use graphical user interface with choices for numerous functions, visual {display unit|computer screen|video display} to display the complete play list and buttons to pack up the player.
>> The player ought to be able to play any song. It ought to be capable of taking part in MP3 files or the other digital audio files.
>> The player ought to enable the user to flick thru the contents of the pc drive to settle on song/s to be vie or queued.
>> It ought to give the user with choice to pause or resume the song.
>> The user ought to be able to play the previous or ensuing song within the play list.
>> Lastly, the user ought to get basic details regarding the present taking part in song. the small print will embody the song name, singer’s name, the length of the song, size of the file, etc.
